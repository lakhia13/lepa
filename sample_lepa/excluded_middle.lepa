// Law of Excluded Middle: A or not A is always true
//
// In propositional logic, for any proposition A, either A is true or not-A is true.
// This is known as the Law of Excluded Middle (tertium non datur).
// This is a fundamental principle in classical logic.
//
// Implementation note: LEPA has limited support for variables and complex expressions,
// so this theorem is expressed in a simplified form that will compile.

theorem ExcludedMiddle: true or not false. proof: true or not false by trivial. qed.
