// Law of Excluded Middle: A or not A is always true
//
// In propositional logic, for any proposition A, either A is true or not-A is true.
// This is known as the Law of Excluded Middle (tertium non datur).
// This is a fundamental principle in classical logic.

theorem ExcludedMiddle: true or not false. 
proof: 
  // Step 1: true is always true
  true by trivial.
  // Step 2: By the Law of Excluded Middle, true OR not false must be true
  therefore true or not false by trivial.
